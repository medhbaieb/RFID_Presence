# RFID_Presence
The project aims to use an ##RFID module to authenticate and verify the entry and presence of members of the RAS IEEE SupCom club in the RAS room. We will be using the Node.js framework for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend to display the members' presence. Additionally, we will be utilizing ESP microcontrollers and their WiFi module to ensure communication between the backend and the RFID module.

The system will function as follows: each club member will be assigned an RFID card containing their profile information. When a member swipes their RFID card on the reader, the system will verify the user's information in the database and check if the member is authorized to enter the room. If the member is authorized, the system will record their entry and update their presence in the database.

The system will also be equipped with an LED display panel that will show the members present in the room in real-time. This will enable the club members to know who is present and facilitate communication between them.

The Node.js framework will be used to develop the backend of the system, which will connect to the database to store information on the members and their presence. HTML, CSS, and JS will be used to develop the frontend, allowing the members to log in and view their presence in the room.

Finally, the ##ESP microcontrollers and their WiFi module will be used to communicate with the RFID reader and the backend of the system. The ESP microcontrollers are popular platforms for IoT development and are perfectly suited for this project.

In summary, this project uses RFID technology, the Node.js framework, and ESP microcontrollers to create an authentication and presence system for the members of the RAS IEEE SupCom club.
